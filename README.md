## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a password generator using the JavaScript knowledge that I gained from Unit 3. This project really tested my limits and made me think outside of what we learned in class. Had to be creative and piece together skills we learned to make this happen.

## Result

The below picture is the final result. There are no changes to the starter code (HTML and CSS). Only JavaScript portion was original to generate password based on user selected criterias.
